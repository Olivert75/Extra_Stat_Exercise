Let N20 be the number of samples which fall below a strength of 20 MPa. In general the fraction of such low strength samples is around 10%, and this is considered acceptable. However, if the samples taken in a particular month yield a value of N20 which exceeds its mean by more than two standard deviations, the plant operations are critically reviewed.\n",
