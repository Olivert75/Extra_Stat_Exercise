Mage Duel!

Let's use what we've learned to play a mage duel!

Imagine your wizard has 6d4 health points and you have spells that do 6d4 damage. "6d4" means rolling six 4-sided dice and summing the result.

Your opposing mage has 4d6 health points and spells that do 4d6. "4d6" means rolling four six-sided dice and summing the result.

Exercises

Simulate mage duels to answer who is the more powerful mage?

Before running simulations, do you have a hypothesis of which mage will win? Do you have a hunch? Write it down. This is your first exercise.
Simulate 10 mage duels. Is there a clear winner? Run that 10 duel simulation again. Was the answer similar?
Do the results change much at 100 duels?
Now, simulate 10,000 mage duels. Is there a clear winner?
